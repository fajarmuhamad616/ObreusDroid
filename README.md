ObreusDroid (Observers Resource Usage Android Tools) 2023

The goal of ObreusDroid tool is to discover resource usage CPU and Memory of An Analyzed Android app and saved to comma-separated values (CSV) file. 

ObreusDroid is able execute automatically on Android app already installed in your phone:
- ObreusDroid will discover resource usage of Android app with iteration a 1 second

<b>Important</b>. This tools created and already tested by me and that time in code have a `sleep .5`, that time means 1 second, but if you test on emulator Android that will <b>not 1 second</b> but means 0.5 second.
