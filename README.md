ObreusDroid (Observers Resource Usage Android Tools) 2023

The goal of ObreusDroid tool is to discover resource usage CPU and Memory of An Analyzed Android app and saved to comma-separated values (CSV) file. 

ObreusDroid is able execute automatically on Android app already installed in your phone:
- Observer resource usage CPU and Memory on process android apps
- Cancelled observer if package name false or wrong write
- Result resource usage CPU and Memory will saved on CSV File
- Result will observer resource usage of Android app with iteration a 1 second

Hopefully this tools benefit for research on resource usage Android app during manual testing

- - - -
<b>Important</b>. This tools created and already tested by me and that time in code have a `sleep .5`, that time means 1 second, but if you test on emulator Android that will <b>not 1 second</b> but means 0.5 second.
